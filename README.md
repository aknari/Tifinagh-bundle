# Tifinagh Keyboard for MacOS

This is a 'bundle' for a typing Tifinagh symbols with a latin keyboard. You need to install this bunch of files under /Users/(your-home-directory)/Library/Keyboard Layouts/Tifinagh.bundle/ Watch out the dash '-' symbol of this repository and replace it with a dot '.' symbol. Once you make that you should be able to install your keyboard by going to "System Settings"->"Keyboard" and viewing, after clicking on the "+" sign, the Tifinagh keyboard option under the "Others" section. Just add it and use it when desired.

Enjoy!
