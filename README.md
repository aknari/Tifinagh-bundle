# Tifinagh Keyboard for MacOS

This is a 'bundle' for a typing Tifinagh symbols with a keyboard with Latin symbols (like the Spanish one). You need to install this bunch of files under /Users/(your-home-directory)/Library/Keyboard Layouts/Tifinagh.bundle/ Watch out the dash '-' symbol of this repository and replace it with a dot '.' symbol. Once you make that you should be able to install your keyboard by going to "System Settings"->"Keyboard" and viewing, after clicking on the "+" sign, the Tifinagh keyboard option under the "Others" section. Just add it and use it when desired.

As a final remark, if you have a different layout in your keyboard and you wish to adapt this setup (with an English keyboard there would be no need for this, but with a French or a German one it might happen), the way for performing this is by touching the 'Contents/Resources/tifinagh.keylayout' file with a proper tool for doing this, like [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/).

ⵙⵙⴱⵖⵔ! Enjoy!
